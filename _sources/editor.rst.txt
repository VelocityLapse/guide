Importing Images Into Existing Projects
---------------------------------------

To import images from your gallery into an existing project, tap an existing project to open it in the Editor, and tap the add button. Then tap one of the options to select either a folder of images or individual images. 

The imported images will be added after the last image of the existing project.
